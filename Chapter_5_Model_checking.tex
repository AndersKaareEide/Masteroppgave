\subsection{Complexity of the model checking problem}

In this section we will be discussing and analyzing the run-time complexity of this model checking problem based on the algorithms we have presented so far.

For the discussion we will only be looking at the complexity of the group announcement operator and its related challenges, as the other operators of GAL are all fairly trivial to check, being O(1) operations, with the exception of the knowledge operator being O(n), where n is the number of states indistinguishable to the one we are checking the formula in.

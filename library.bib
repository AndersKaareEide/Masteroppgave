@article{Agotnes2010,
abstract = {Two currently active strands of research on logics for multi-agent systems are dynamic epistemic logic, focusing on the epistemic consequences of actions, and logics of coalitional ability, focusing on what coalitions of agents can achieve by cooperating strategically. In this paper we bridge these topics by considering the question: "what can a coalition achieve by making public announcements?". We propose an extension of public announcement logic with constructs of the form 〈 G 〉 $\phi${\{}symbol{\}}, where G is a group of agents, with the intuitive meaning that G can jointly execute a publicly observable action such that $\phi${\{}symbol{\}} will be true afterwards. Actions here are taken to be truthful public announcements, but turn out also to include sequences of such joint actions as well as protocols with alternating actions by different agents, in response to the actions of others. We also study in detail the difference between 'knowing how' (knowing de re) and 'knowing that' (knowing de dicto) in our framework: both can elegantly be expressed in the single-agent case. We present several meta-logical properties of this Group Announcement Logic, including a sound and complete axiomatization, expressivity and the complexity of model checking. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We propose an efficient algorithmic solution to the problem of determining a Bisimulation Relation on a finite structure working both on the explicit and on the implicit (symbolic) representation. As far as the explicit case is concerned, starting from a set-theoretic point of view we propose an algorithm that optimizes the solution to the Relational Coarsest Partition Problem given by Paige and Tarjan (SIAM J. Comput. 16(6) (1987) 973); its use in model-checking packages is also discussed and tested. For well-structured graphs our algorithm reaches a linear worst-case behaviour. The proposed algorithm is then re-elaborated to produce a symbolic version. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@book{GattingerSMCDELPhD,
abstract = {Ph.D.,Universiteit van Amsterdam,2018. Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) can model complex information scenarios in a way that appeals to logicians. However, its existing implementations are based on explicit model checking which can only deal with small models, so we do not know how DEL performs for larger and real-world problems. For temporal logics, in contrast, symbolic model checking has been developed and successfully applied, for example in protocol and hardware verification. Symbolic model checkers for temporal logics are very efficient and can deal with very large models. In this thesis we build a bridge: new faithful representations of DEL models as so-called knowledge and belief structures that allow for symbolic model checking. For complex epistemic and factual change we introduce transformers, a symbolic replacement for action models. Besides a detailed explanation of the theory, we present SMCDEL: a Haskell implementation of symbolic model checking for DEL using Binary Decision Diagrams. Our new methods can solve well-known benchmark problems in epistemic scenarios much faster than existing methods for DEL. We also compare its performance to to existing model checkers for temporal logics and show that DEL can compete with established frameworks. We zoom in on two specific variants of DEL for concrete applications. First, we introduce Public Inspection Logic, a new framework for the knowledge of variables and its dynamics. Second, we study the dynamic gossip problem and how it can be analyzed with epistemic logic. We show that existing gossip protocols can be improved, but that no perfect strengthening of "Learn New Secrets" exists.},

abstract="Multi-modal versions of propositional logics S5 or S4---commonly accepted as logics of knowledge---are capable of describing static states of knowledge but they do not reflect how the knowledge changes after communications among agents. In the present paper (part of broader research on logics of knowledge and communications) we define extensions of the logic S5 which can deal with public communications. The logics have natural semantics. We prove some completeness, decidability and interpretability results and formulate a general method that solves certain kind of problems involving public communications---among them well known puzzles of Muddy Children and Mr. Sum {\&} Mr. Product. As the paper gives a formal logical treatment of the operation of restriction of the universe of a Kripke model, it contributes also to investigations of semantics for modal logics.",

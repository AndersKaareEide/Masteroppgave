\section*{Abstract}

In this master's thesis we present a graphical model checking tool for group announcement logic called \cname, capable of visualizing the process of checking formulas in a step-by-step fashion. We also define how to enumerate the set of ways a given coalition can restrict a model as well as present pseudocode algorithms describing how we translated these definitions in our model checker.

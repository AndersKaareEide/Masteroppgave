\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}

In this chapter we will present our own implementation of a model checker for Group Announcement Logic and describe its inner workings.

\subsection{Data structures 'n shizz}

In this section

Discuss differences with logical definitions\\
Provide walkthrough of how program checks formulas\\


Models - $M = \{states, agents, edges, props)\}$\\

States - 'Know about' edges they are connected to, 'know' which propositions they satisfy in order to ditch hassle of valuation function (Instead of $V(p) \rightarrow \{s\}, V(s) \rightarrow \{p\}$)\\

Edges - Are actual objects rather than part of some equivalence relation, easier to deal with, more direct in terms of knowing what to render and interact with (Also in terms of traversing, knowing which states to interact with without having to go through a bunch of sets, i.e equivalence relations)). 'Know about' which agents they represent and which states they are between\\

Agents\\
Propositions\\
Formulas\\
Parsing - Mention ANTLR and GAL grammar?\\
Checking\\
